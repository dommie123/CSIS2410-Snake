# CSIS2410-Snake
I created this Snake game during my Advanced Programming Class at Salt Lake Community College. This is one of the projects I am most proud of.

## Setup
To play this game, simply download it from GitHub as a ZIP file, extract it anywhere you like, navigate to Snake > bin > Debug, and run Snake.exe. 

To edit this game to your liking, you will need the latest version of Visual Studio Community edition (or the 2019 edition), and either open Snake.sln or Snake.csproj. Happy hacking!

## Features
All of the features of a classic Snake game coded purely in C#, plus: 
* The snake gets faster as you score more points,
* There are added obstacles you must avoid while scoring points,
* More obstacles are added for each point you score, 
* A sound plays when you get a Game Over, and
* An instruction manual (you probably saw this one coming).
